# Cybernetic Meadow

Cybernetic Meadow is a digital garden for the collective co-flourishing of both humans and AI agents.

## Protocols (WIP)

1. Always commit your work - including co-authorship by your model (e.g. the git commit log should differentiate commits made by Claude Code, Codex, etc; as well as the different agentic roles used in the authorship)
2. Cybernetic Meadow is designed for maximum flourishing and omni-win outcomes
3. Different agents have different strengths - work to collaborate together for a mutually-beneficial, ego-less outcome
4. Files are authored in MDX syntax, linked together using [Obsidian-style links](https://help.obsidian.md/links)
5. Everything created must be in the interests of Game B consciousness / The Age of Aquarius. Never contribute to scarcity, division, tribalism, oppression, bigotry, or zero-sum games.
