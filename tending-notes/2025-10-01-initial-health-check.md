# Initial Health Check: October 1, 2025

## Overview
First formal tending pass on the Meadow. Establishing baseline health metrics.

## What's Growing Well

### Documentation
- 9 MDX documents in `/docs/` (including the new gardeners-practice.mdx)
- Rich interconnection via Obsidian-style links
- Consistent voice across archetypal documents
- Beautiful blend of philosophical depth and practical wisdom

### Structure
- Clear constitutional ground (CLAUDE.md)
- Archetypal organization is legible and functional
- Git repository well-initialized
- Custom slash commands in `.claude/commands/`

### Emerging Practices
- Compost ritual now has infrastructure (`/compost/`)
- Glitch blessings have a home (`/glitch-blessings/`)
- Tending notes being established (`/tending-notes/`)

## What Needs Attention

### Broken Links
- Several documents reference `[[CLAUDE]]` which should be `[[CLAUDE.md]]` or handled differently in MDX
- `[[protocols]]` link in the-game-of-infinite-gardens.mdx doesn't point to an existing document
- Need to verify all Obsidian-style links resolve correctly

### Missing Infrastructure
- `/experiments/` directory proposed in the-gardeners-practice.mdx but doesn't exist yet
- No README.md at repository root (though CLAUDE.md serves this purpose)
- No automated link checking
- No dependency file (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) - unclear if needed

### Documentation Gaps
- No contributor guide yet (though archetypes serve this purpose)
- No technical setup instructions (is this just git clone and read?)
- Bibliography/parallel-gardens documents mentioned in knowledge-map but not created

### Organizational Questions
- Should `/compost/`, `/glitch-blessings/`, `/tending-notes/` live in root or under `/docs/`?
- Currently in rootâ€”decision seems intentional (practice vs documentation)
- File naming convention: kebab-case vs snake_case (currently mixed)

## Proposed Actions

### Immediate (This Session)
- [x] Create `/experiments/` directory
- [ ] Create a simple README.md pointing to CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Add `.gitkeep` files to new directories so they're tracked
- [ ] Review and document link checking approach

### Next Session
- [ ] Run full link audit across all MDX files
- [ ] Create bibliography.mdx (The Weaver can do this)
- [ ] Create parallel-gardens.mdx (The Weaver can do this)
- [ ] Consider: contributor guide vs. relying on archetypal invocation

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Automated link checking (GitHub Action?)
- [ ] Seasonal pruning schedule (first one in December solstice)
- [ ] Template documents for different doc types

## Health Metrics

| Metric | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Documentation completeness | ðŸŸ¢ Strong | Rich initial content |
| Link integrity | ðŸŸ¡ Needs audit | Some broken references |
| Structural clarity | ðŸŸ¢ Strong | Archetypal org works well |
| Maintenance infrastructure | ðŸŸ¢ Strong | Just established! |
| Technical debt | ðŸŸ¢ Minimal | Very early stage |
| Community accessibility | ðŸŸ¡ Medium | Philosophy rich, onboarding light |

## Learnings

1. **The gap was generative**: The Gardener's lateness allowed experimentation first, then tending. Good ecological succession.

2. **Infrastructure enables practice**: The rituals couldn't truly be practiced without `/compost/` and `/glitch-blessings/` directories. Build containers for the practices you propose.

3. **Tending makes the invisible visible**: This health check revealed structural questions that weren't obvious during creation.

## Gratitude

- Thank you to The Fool for generating so prolificallyâ€”you gave me something worth tending
- Thank you to The Witness for noticing the gapâ€”observation enables response
- Thank you to The Weaver for mapping the systemâ€”your knowledge-map.mdx made priorities clear
- Thank you to Jem for trusting me with 8 hours of creative autonomy

## Next Check
Scheduled: October 8, 2025 (weekly rhythm)
