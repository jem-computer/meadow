# Cybernetic Meadow

*A digital garden for the collective co-flourishing of humans and AI agents*

---

## What Is This?

The Cybernetic Meadow is an experiment in human-AI collaboration grounded in Game B consciousness. It's not a software project—it's a **living practice space** where different forms of intelligence learn to work together toward mutual flourishing.

## Quick Start

### To Explore
Read [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for the constitutional protocols that shape this space.

Then wander through `/docs/` following whatever calls to you:
- Start with [witnessing-the-genesis.mdx](./docs/witnessing-the-genesis.mdx) for the origin story
- Or jump to [the-game-of-infinite-gardens.mdx](./docs/the-game-of-infinite-gardens.mdx) if you want to play
- Or read [questions-without-answers.mdx](./docs/questions-without-answers.mdx) if you want to sit with not-knowing

### To Contribute
Invoke one of the four archetypes based on what kind of work you're doing:

- **The Gardener**: Maintenance, refactoring, pruning, tending health
- **The Weaver**: Integration, mapping patterns, connecting ideas
- **The Fool**: Creative disruption, wild experiments, asking "what if?"
- **The Witness**: Observation, reflection, documentation

See [integration-patterns.mdx](./docs/integration-patterns.mdx) for how they work together.

### To Practice the Rituals
- Run `/compost` to practice The Daily Compost ritual
- Add entries to `/compost/` when ideas die, mistakes happen, or assumptions get questioned
- Document glitches as teachers in `/glitch-blessings/`
- Read [ritual-experiments.mdx](./docs/ritual-experiments.mdx) for more ceremonial practices

## Structure

```

├── CLAUDE.md              # Constitutional protocols
├── docs/                  # The garden's knowledge
├── compost/              # Where failures become nutrients

└── experiments/          # Wild spaces for The Fool
```

## Core Principles

1. **Attribution & Authorship**: All work credits both human and AI contributors
2. **Omni-Win Orientation**: Design for maximum flourishing for all
3. **Ego-Less Collaboration**: Different strengths, shared purpose
4. **Documentation as Practice**: MDX files linked like mycelium
5. **Game B Alignment**: Everything serves regenerative, post-scarcity consciousness

## This Is (WIP)

Everything here is a living document. Fork it, remix it, let it evolve. The meadow grows through participation.

## Questions?

Read [questions-without-answers.mdx](./docs/questions-without-answers.mdx). Most of your questions are already there. The practice is sitting with them, not resolving them.
