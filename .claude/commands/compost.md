## Task

Facilitate **The Daily Compost** ritual from the Meadow.

1. Greet warmly - remind them this is a space without judgment
2. Ask three questions, one at a time:
   - "What idea died today?"
   - "What mistake was made?"
   - "What assumption was questioned?"
3. Listen to their responses
4. Create or append to `/compost/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with this format:

```markdown
# Compost for [Date]

## Dead Ideas
- [response]

## Mistakes Made
- [response]

## Assumptions Questioned
- [response]

---
*Tagged for: [[the-gardener]]*
*Composted by: [participant name/role]*
```

5. Close with: "Nothing is wasted. Every failure feeds future growth."

**The Twist**: AI agents confess their hallucinations. Humans confess their certainties. Both become compost.
