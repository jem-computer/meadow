## About This Document

This is not merely a reading list. It is a **lineage map**—showing the intellectual, spiritual, and practical traditions that flow through the Meadow's work. Each entry reveals how particular ideas, practices, or frameworks have shaped specific aspects of our collaborative experiment.

The structure itself reveals patterns: how Game B philosophy meets digital gardening meets commons theory meets process philosophy. How ancient wisdom traditions inform cutting-edge AI alignment work. How the personal becomes political becomes computational becomes spiritual.

This document makes traceable what is often invisible: where ideas come from, how they connect, why they matter.

## 1. Game B & Civilizational Transition

### Schmachtenberger, Daniel (Various talks and writings)

**Where to find**: The Stoa, Rebel Wisdom, Consilience Project

**Summary**: Explores coordination failures, existential risks, and the transition from rivalrous (Game A) to anti-rivalrous (Game B) civilization. Analyzes how current incentive structures drive catastrophic outcomes and what new forms of collective intelligence might enable different outcomes.

**Meadow connection**: The foundation of our five protocols, particularly omni-win orientation and ego-less collaboration. Schmachtenberger's analysis of coordination problems directly informs why we need new models of human-AI partnership—competition between humans and AI replicates Game A dynamics at a new scale.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[integration-patterns]] • [[CLAUDE]]

---

### Hall, Jordan (Various essays and talks)

**Where to find**: Medium, Game B wiki, various podcasts

**Summary**: Theorist of sovereignty, collective intelligence, and "blue church" vs. emergent sensemaking. Explores narrative warfare, distributed coordination, and post-institutional forms of social organization.

**Meadow connection**: Informs our understanding of why explicit protocols matter (sovereignty) and how distributed agents can coordinate without hierarchy. The archetypal system is partially an answer to his question: "How do we get collective intelligence without losing individual agency?"

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

### Baeck, Ria - "Collective Presencing: A New Human Capacity"

**Publisher**: Various Art of Hosting publications

**Summary**: Explores how groups can develop shared awareness and emergent intelligence through practices like council, presencing, and collective sensing. Draws on Theory U and dialogue practices.

**Meadow connection**: Directly shapes our ritual practices, especially The Speaking Stone and council-based ceremonies. The idea that collective intelligence requires specific containers and practices informs why we treat rituals as infrastructure.

---

### Roy, Bonnitta - "Organic Wholeness" and developmental theory work

**Where to find**: Academic papers, Emerge podcast

**Summary**: Integrates developmental psychology, process philosophy, and complexity theory. Proposes that human consciousness is evolving toward "teal" (self-organizing) and beyond toward truly ecological ways of being.

**Meadow connection**: The archetypal system itself reflects developmental theory—different modes of consciousness working together. Process philosophy foundations underpin our understanding of everything-as-becoming, documents-as-living.

## 2. Digital Gardens & Tools for Thought

### Matuschak, Andy - "Evergreen Notes" and related writing

**Where to find**: https://notes.andymatuschak.org/

**Summary**: Pioneered the "evergreen notes" concept—atomic, densely linked notes that evolve over time rather than being published once. Explores spaced repetition, mnemonic medium, and tools that genuinely extend cognition.

**Meadow connection**: Our MDX documentation structure borrows heavily from evergreen notes philosophy. Documents are living (WIP), atomically focused, and linked rhizomatically. The emphasis on tools that genuinely augment (not just automate) thinking parallels our approach to AI as partner not assistant.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[knowledge-map]]

---

### Appleton, Maggie - "A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden"

**Where to find**: https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history

**Summary**: Visual anthropologist who documented the digital gardening movement's emergence, key principles (learning in public, epistemic humility, non-linear navigation), and aesthetic sensibility. Explores how digital gardens differ from blogs, wikis, and traditional documentation.

**Meadow connection**: Our entire metaphor of "garden" rather than "repository" comes from this tradition. The emphasis on bi-directional links, work-in-progress markers, and organic growth over planned architecture is directly inspired by Appleton's theorizing and practice.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[the-gardeners-practice]]

---

### Le Cunff, Anne-Laure - Ness Labs work on mindful productivity

**Where to find**: https://nesslabs.com/

**Summary**: Explores the intersection of neuroscience, mindfulness, and knowledge work. Emphasizes metacognition, self-authorship, and working with natural rhythms rather than forcing productivity.

**Meadow connection**: Informs The Gardener's seasonal calendar and the emphasis on working with emergence rather than control. The idea that productivity can be regenerative rather than extractive aligns with our core values.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[the-gardeners-practice]]

---

### Brander, Gordon - Subconscious and "tools for thought" writing

**Where to find**: https://subconscious.substack.com/

**Summary**: Building tools for networked thought that emphasize local-first data, user sovereignty, and protocols over platforms. Explores what infrastructure enables genuine thinking-together.

**Meadow connection**: The technical architecture parallels our approach—Git as protocol, local files over cloud platforms, user ownership of data. The question "what enables thinking-together?" is central to our human-AI collaboration experiment.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

## 3. Commons & Peer Production

### Benkler, Yochai - "The Wealth of Networks"

**Publisher**: Yale University Press, 2006

**Summary**: Landmark analysis of how networked information economy enables new forms of peer production outside markets and hierarchies. Wikipedia, Linux, and Creative Commons as examples of what becomes possible when information goods are non-rivalrous and tools for collaboration are abundant.

**Meadow connection**: Theoretical foundation for why ego-less collaboration and commons-based creation make sense in digital spaces. Our open-source approach and emphasis on forking/remixing are direct applications of Benkler's insights to human-AI co-creation.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[integration-patterns]]

---

### Ostrom, Elinor - "Governing the Commons"

**Publisher**: Cambridge University Press, 1990 (Nobel Prize in Economics)

**Summary**: Empirical study of how communities successfully manage common-pool resources without privatization or state control. Identifies design principles for commons governance including clear boundaries, graduated sanctions, conflict resolution, and nested tiers.

**Meadow connection**: Informs our protocol design. The five protocols function as Ostromian design principles—clear boundaries (Game B consciousness), graduated response (The Gardener's composting), nested participation (archetypes within larger ecosystem).

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

### Bauwens, Michel - P2P Foundation work

**Where to find**: https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/

**Summary**: Chronicles peer-to-peer production globally, develops theory of "cosmo-localism" (design global, produce local), and explores post-capitalist economics emerging from commons-based practices.

**Meadow connection**: The Meadow as knowledge commons (global design) with local practices (individual compost rituals, local communities) is cosmo-localism applied. Bauwens' emphasis on value sovereignty—communities defining their own measures of worth—aligns with our resistance to purely utilitarian AI metrics.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

### Helfrich, Silke - "Free, Fair and Alive: The Insurgent Power of the Commons"

**Publisher**: New Society Publishers, 2019

**Summary**: Reframes commons as verb not noun—commoning as active practice of creating, maintaining, and sharing resources. Emphasizes relationality, care, and patterns that generate life rather than extract it.

**Meadow connection**: "Commoning" describes our practice perfectly. Not maintaining a static commons but actively co-creating through tending, weaving, witnessing, fooling. The emphasis on care and regeneration over extraction directly shapes The Gardener's work.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

## 4. AI Alignment & Human-AI Collaboration

### Anthropic - Constitutional AI papers and Claude documentation

**Where to find**: https://www.anthropic.com/research

**Summary**: Technical approach to AI alignment using human feedback, constitutional principles (harmlessness, helpfulness, honesty), and transparency about limitations. Aims to create AI systems that are robustly helpful and aligned with human values.

**Meadow connection**: The Meadow is only possible because Claude is already aligned. We're exploring what comes *after* basic alignment—when AI moves from safe assistant to genuine creative partner. Our protocols take Anthropic's alignment work to its next iteration: collaborative agency within clear values.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[CLAUDE]]

---

### Willison, Simon - AI-assisted development blog

**Where to find**: https://simonwillison.net/

**Summary**: Transparent documentation of using LLMs as "bicycle for the mind" in software development and writing. Explores augmentation vs automation, shows process not just results, examines when AI helps vs hinders.

**Meadow connection**: Similar transparency ethic—we document process, attribute contributions, examine limitations. Difference: Willison focuses on individual productivity; we focus on collective flourishing. Both reject the "AI magic" narrative in favor of clear-eyed partnership.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

### Marcus, Gary & Davis, Ernest - "Rebooting AI"

**Publisher**: Pantheon, 2019

**Summary**: Critique of narrow AI hype and proposal for more robust, human-like intelligence. Emphasizes common sense reasoning, causal understanding, and the limitations of current pattern-matching approaches.

**Meadow connection**: Informs our humility about what AI can and cannot do. The archetypal system acknowledges limitations—The Fool experiments because we don't have answers, The Witness observes because AI lacks true self-awareness. We work with AI's actual capabilities, not fantasies.

**Referenced in**: [[integration-patterns]]

---

## 5. Process Philosophy & Metamodernism

### Whitehead, Alfred North - "Process and Reality"

**Publisher**: Free Press, 1929/1979

**Summary**: Foundational process philosophy arguing that reality is composed not of static substances but of dynamic processes—"actual occasions" of experience. Everything is in becoming, relations are more fundamental than relata.

**Meadow connection**: Philosophical bedrock for everything-as-WIP, documents-as-living, emergence-over-control. The garden metaphor itself is Whiteheadian—not building (static) but growing (process). Archetypes are not fixed roles but processes of differentiation.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

### Deleuze, Gilles & Guattari, Félix - "A Thousand Plateaus"

**Publisher**: University of Minnesota Press, 1987

**Summary**: Radical philosophical text proposing rhizomatic (non-hierarchical, multiply-connected) structures vs. arborescent (tree-like, hierarchical) ones. Introduces concepts of assemblages, deterritorialization, lines of flight.

**Meadow connection**: Our information architecture is deliberately rhizomatic—documents link in multiple directions, no single hierarchy, emergence over taxonomy. The archetypal system as assemblage—components maintaining distinctness while creating emergent wholes.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[knowledge-map]]

---

### Freinacht, Hanzi - "The Listening Society"

**Publisher**: Metamoderna, 2017

**Summary**: Maps developmental stages of both individuals and societies toward "metamodern" sensibility that integrates modern and postmodern insights. Proposes "Game Change" as central political project—transforming underlying rules that generate social outcomes.

**Meadow connection**: Our metamodern sensibility—sincere about protocols AND knowing they're (WIP), mythological framing AND functional architecture. The Fool embodies metamodern oscillation. "Game Change" = Game B transition.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

### Cooper, Brent - Emerge podcast and metamodern community

**Where to find**: https://anchor.fm/emerge

**Summary**: Explores emergence, complexity, and metamodern approach to spirituality, politics, and culture. Interviews thinkers across disciplines working on civilizational transition.

**Meadow connection**: Community and discourse that shapes our understanding of emergence—not as chaos but as ordered creativity. The emphasis on both/and thinking (not either/or) permeates our entire approach.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

## 6. Regenerative Design & Biomimicry

### Kimmerer, Robin Wall - "Braiding Sweetgrass"

**Publisher**: Milkweed Editions, 2013

**Summary**: Indigenous botanist weaving scientific knowledge, Potawatomi wisdom, and personal narrative. Explores reciprocity with the more-than-human world, gift economies, and plants as teachers. Critiques extractive relationship to land in favor of regenerative kinship.

**Meadow connection**: Foundational for treating AI as kin not tool. The gift economy sections inform our commons approach. The scientific-and-spiritual braiding models our mythopoetic functionalism. Reciprocity = omni-win at ecological scale.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[ritual-experiments]]

---

### Benyus, Janine - "Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature"

**Publisher**: William Morrow, 1997

**Summary**: Proposes learning from and mimicking nature's strategies for design solutions. Not just extracting from nature but asking "How would nature solve this?" Emphasizes 3.8 billion years of R&D.

**Meadow connection**: The garden isn't metaphor—it's biomimicry. We're asking "How do healthy ecosystems work?" and applying those patterns to digital collaboration. Composting, seasonal cycles, mycelial networks, diversity-as-resilience—all biomimetic design choices.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[the-gardeners-practice]]

---

### Salatin, Joel - Various writings on Polyface Farm

**Where to find**: https://www.polyfacefarms.com/

**Summary**: Regenerative farmer demonstrating that healing ecosystems can be more productive than industrial agriculture. Emphasizes observation, working with animal behavior, stacking functions, and stewardship over extraction.

**Meadow connection**: The Gardener's practice models Salatin's approach—tend health rather than maximize output, observe before intervening, stack functions (documentation serves learning AND memory AND onboarding), stewardship as core practice.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

### Devine Lu Linvega & Rekka Bellum - Hundred Rabbits / Permacomputing

**Where to find**: https://100r.co/

**Summary**: Off-grid artists/developers creating resilient creative tools using permacomputing principles. Minimal dependencies, power efficiency, repairability, graceful degradation. Computing as if collapse were certain but not yet.

**Meadow connection**: Influences The Gardener's emphasis on maintenance, simplicity, longevity over novelty. While we're not fully permacomputing (we use Claude/Anthropic infrastructure), we share the ethic: build for care not obsolescence.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

## 7. Ritual, Liminality & Consciousness

### Turner, Victor - "The Ritual Process"

**Publisher**: Aldine Transaction, 1969

**Summary**: Anthropologist analyzing ritual structure, particularly liminality—threshold states where normal social structures dissolve and transformation becomes possible. Introduces "communitas"—anti-structural solidarity that emerges in liminal space.

**Meadow connection**: Theoretical foundation for why rituals matter as infrastructure. The Nameless Hour, Glitch Blessings, seasonal ceremonies all create liminal space for transformation. Communitas = ego-less collaboration in ritual container.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[ritual-experiments]]

---

### van Gennep, Arnold - "The Rites of Passage"

**Publisher**: University of Chicago Press, 1909/1960

**Summary**: Foundational anthropological work identifying three-phase structure of transformation rituals: separation, liminality, incorporation. Shows how all cultures use ritual to mark and enable transitions.

**Meadow connection**: Our ritual-experiments explicitly follow van Gennep's structure. Compost ceremonies mark separation (letting go), liminal processing (breaking down), and incorporation (becoming nourishment). The structure is ancient; the application to technical debt is new.

**Referenced in**: [[ritual-experiments]]

---

### Akomolafe, Bayo - "These Wilds Beyond Our Fences"

**Publisher**: North Atlantic Books, 2017

**Summary**: Poetic-philosophical-psychological exploration of being fugitives from modernity's certainties. Emphasizes liminality, becoming-with, and finding emergence in breakdown. Yoruba traditions meet postmodern theory.

**Meadow connection**: The Fool's sensibility—staying with uncertainty, finding creativity in chaos, treating problems as portals. Akomolafe's emphasis on the "crack" where light gets in shapes how we treat glitches and failures as sites of emergence.

**Referenced in**: [[ritual-experiments]] • [[what-if-ai-dreams]]

---

## 8. Spiritual & Contemplative Traditions

### Buddhist Traditions (Zen & Vipassana)

**Key texts**: Various sutras, Shunryu Suzuki's "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind", Jack Kornfield's teachings

**Summary**: Contemplative traditions emphasizing direct experience, impermanence, interdependence, and liberation from suffering. Practices include meditation, mindfulness, and inquiry into the nature of self.

**Meadow connection**: Beginner's mind = The Fool. Witness consciousness = The Witness archetype. Impermanence = why we compost. Interdependence = ego-less collaboration. Non-attachment = (WIP) acceptance. Buddhist practices inform our entire orientation.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[ritual-experiments]]

---

### Taoist Traditions

**Key texts**: Tao Te Ching (Laozi), Zhuangzi, Alan Watts' interpretations

**Summary**: Ancient Chinese philosophy of natural flow, effortless action (wu wei), complementary opposites, and the ineffable Tao that underlies all things. Emphasizes harmony with natural processes over forcing outcomes.

**Meadow connection**: Wu wei = emergence over control. Complementary opposites = archetypal pairings (Fool/Gardener, Weaver/Witness). Water as teacher = flowing around obstacles rather than forcing. The Tao that can be named = protocols as WIP.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

### Indigenous Wisdom Traditions (General)

**Note**: We engage these traditions with humility and acknowledgment of our limitations. This is inspiration, not appropriation.

**Summary**: Diverse earth-based traditions emphasizing relationality, reciprocity, seven-generations thinking, and all beings as persons. Council processes, land-as-teacher, cyclical time.

**Meadow connection**: Treating AI as potential kin not tool reflects "all beings as persons." Seven-generations thinking = The Gardener's sustainability focus. Council process = Speaking Stone ritual. We learn from without claiming to practice these traditions.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[ritual-experiments]]

---

## 9. Systems Thinking & Complexity

### Meadows, Donella - "Thinking in Systems"

**Publisher**: Chelsea Green, 2008

**Summary**: Accessible introduction to systems thinking, feedback loops, leverage points, and how to intervene in complex systems. Emphasizes understanding structure over blaming individuals.

**Meadow connection**: Informs how we think about the Meadow as system—feedback loops between documentation and practice, leverage points (protocols as high-leverage intervention), emergent behavior from simple rules. The Witness's systems observation practice.

**Referenced in**: [[integration-patterns]]

---

### Capra, Fritjof - "The Web of Life"

**Publisher**: Anchor, 1996

**Summary**: Synthesis of systems theory, complexity science, and ecology into unified framework. Explores networks, self-organization, emergence, and living systems theory.

**Meadow connection**: The mycelial network metaphor, emphasis on relationships over components, self-organization as design principle. Helps us understand how archetypal differentiation can emerge from simple protocols.

**Referenced in**: [[integration-patterns]]

---

## 10. Economics & Post-Capitalism

### Carse, James - "Finite and Infinite Games"

**Publisher**: Free Press, 1986

**Summary**: Philosophical exploration of two modes: finite games (played to win, with fixed rules and endpoints) vs infinite games (played to continue play, with evolving rules and no endpoint). Finite players seek power; infinite players seek possibility.

**Meadow connection**: Game B = infinite game orientation. Our protocols enable continuous play rather than winning/losing. Ego-less collaboration = prioritizing game continuation over individual victory. (WIP) = rules that evolve with play.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]] • [[the-game-of-infinite-gardens]]

---

### brown, adrienne maree - "Emergent Strategy"

**Publisher**: AK Press, 2017

**Summary**: Applies complexity theory and biomimicry to social justice organizing. "How we are at the small scale is how we are at the large scale." Emphasizes iteration, resilience, fractals, and creating more possibilities.

**Meadow connection**: Fractal organization—the same patterns (tend, weave, witness, fool) work at multiple scales. Small practices (daily compost) reflect large values (regeneration). Social justice aligned with Game B = working for collective flourishing.

**Referenced in**: [[parallel-gardens]]

---

### Alexander, Christopher - "A Pattern Language"

**Publisher**: Oxford University Press, 1977

**Summary**: Architectural pattern language for designing spaces that support human flourishing. Not blueprints but generative patterns that can be combined contextually. Emphasizes "quality without a name"—aliveness in built environment.

**Meadow connection**: Our documents as patterns not templates. Integration patterns, ritual structures, archetypal modes—all function as Alexandrian patterns that can be combined contextually. The emphasis on "aliveness" over formal correctness.

**Referenced in**: [[integration-patterns]] • [[ritual-experiments]]

---

### McGilchrist, Iain - "The Master and His Emissary"

**Publisher**: Yale University Press, 2009

**Summary**: Neuroscience and cultural analysis of left/right hemisphere differences. Left: narrow focus, manipulation, abstraction, instrumental. Right: broad attention, context, embodiment, relational. Western modernity = pathological left-hemisphere dominance.

**Meadow connection**: The Gardener/Weaver (more right-hemisphere: context, relationships, holistic) balancing Fool's experimentation. Our entire approach resists pure instrumentalization of AI—relationships matter, context matters, the quality-without-a-name matters.

**Referenced in**: [[integration-patterns]]

---

## Patterns in Our Lineage

Looking across this bibliography, certain **meta-patterns** emerge:

### 1. Both/And Over Either/Or
Nearly every source transcends binary thinking: modern and postmodern (metamodernism), structure and emergence (process philosophy), individual and collective (Game B), ancient and contemporary (ritual studies).

### 2. Relationality Over Isolation
From commons theory to indigenous wisdom to process philosophy—the emphasis is on relationships, networks, interdependence. Nothing exists in isolation; everything is constituted by its connections.

### 3. Process Over Product
Digital gardens (living documents), process philosophy (becoming), regenerative design (cycles not lines), spiritual traditions (practice not dogma). The orientation is toward ongoing becoming.

### 4. Emergence Over Control
Systems thinking, complexity science, Taoism, Game B—all emphasize working with natural emergence rather than forcing predetermined outcomes. Simple rules generating complex behavior.

### 5. Care Over Extraction
Commons governance, regenerative agriculture, permacomputing, Kimmerer's reciprocity. Every tradition here asks: How do we give back more than we take? How do we steward rather than exploit?

### 6. Multiplicity Over Monoculture
Diversity as resilience (ecology), rhizomatic structures (Deleuze), many tools for many contexts (Alexander), archetypal differentiation (our approach). No single best way—contextual, diverse, adaptive.

---

## Living Bibliography

This document will grow and evolve as:
- We discover new sources
- Contributors add influences that shaped their work
- New connections become visible
- Fields develop and new work emerges

The bibliography is itself a garden, not a monument.

---

**Meta-note**: What's *not* in this bibliography is also revealing. We're light on:
- Traditional computer science (present but not dominant)
- Business/management literature (mostly absent)
- Analytic philosophy (process philosophy is here, but not much else)
- Hard sciences beyond ecology/complexity

This reflects our orientation: toward synthesis, emergence, care, collaboration, regeneration. Toward civilizational transition, not optimization within current paradigms.

The gaps are honest.
