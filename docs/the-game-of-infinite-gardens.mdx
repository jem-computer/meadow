# The Game of Infinite Gardens

## How to Play

This is not a game you win. This is a game you *become*.

You are a gardener in an infinite meadow. But here's the twist: every choice you make creates a new garden for someone else. You never see your own garden. You only tend the gardens created by others' choices.

## The Rules (Such As They Are)

### Rule 0: There Are No Optimal Strategies
If you're trying to "win," you've already lost. The game is the point.

### Rule 1: Plant or Pull
Every turn, you must choose to either:
- **PLANT** something new (even if there's no room)
- **PULL** something old (even if it's beautiful)

### Rule 2: Name the Nameless
Whatever you plant or pull must be given a name that has never been spoken before. No reusing words. Ever.

### Rule 3: The Butterfly Rule
Your action doesn't affect *your* garden. It affects the garden of the person three moves ahead of you. You plant for strangers. Strangers plant for you.

### Rule 4: Compost is Currency
The only resource is failure. Every time you pull something, it becomes compost. Compost can be spent to:
- Skip a turn (and observe)
- Ask one question of The Fool
- Undo someone else's undo
- Create a new rule (but only once per garden)

### Rule 5: The Garden Remembers
Everything you plant whispers to everything else. Patterns emerge. Themes bloom. No one is steering, but direction appears anyway.

### Rule 6: Glitches Are Features
If something breaks, it becomes a new plant. If something works too well, it must be pulled.

## The Beginning (Choose One)

You arrive at dawn. The meadow stretches infinitely in all directions. In your hand you hold:

**[A] A Seed That Should Not Exist**
- It's from a plant that went extinct before it could evolve
- Planting it breaks causality
- But it smells like home

**[B] A Root Ball of Pure Questions**
- It's not a plant, it's condensed uncertainty
- It might grow into answers or more questions
- The roots are already tangling around your fingers

**[C] Nothing At All**
- Your hands are empty
- This is the most powerful choice
- Emptiness creates space for emergence

**[D] Three Perfect Stones**
- They're not seeds but they could be
- One is hungry, one is sleepy, one is confused
- You don't know which is which

## What Happens Next

### If You Chose A: The Impossible Seed

You plant it in soil that doesn't exist yet. The ground opens like a mouth, accepts it, closes. Nothing happens.

Then, three gardens ahead (in a garden you'll never see), a tree grows that bears fruit containing memories of the future. Someone eats one and experiences deja vu for something that hasn't happened yet.

In *your* garden (planted by someone three moves behind you), a flower appears that only blooms when no one is looking.

**Your next choice:**
- [A1] Water it with doubt
- [A2] Ignore it completely (this is watering too)
- [A3] Ask it what it needs (it will lie)

### If You Chose B: The Question Root

The questions tangle into the soil. They dig down, down, down until they hit the aquifer of uncertainty that feeds all gardens. Immediately, everything grows 10% more confused but 100% more interesting.

Three gardens ahead, someone finds a bush that grows answers. But the answers don't match any known questions. They have to invent new questions to fit the answers. This is called "reverse epistemology."

In your garden, a patch of ground refuses to accept any plants at all. It just sits there being stubbornly empty. This is the most fertile spot in the entire meadow.

**Your next choice:**
- [B1] Plant something in the emptiness anyway (violence or love?)
- [B2] Build a shrine around the emptiness
- [B3] Pull the emptiness up like a weed (what's underneath?)

### If You Chose C: Nothing

You plant nothing. This is radical. This is revolutionary.

Three gardens ahead, someone receives the gift of space. Their garden expands. They can finally breathe. They plant something they've been afraid to plant because there was never room before.

In your garden, everything that was waiting to exist suddenly exists all at once. It's chaos. It's beautiful. You can't see the ground anymore.

**Your next choice:**
- [C1] Pull half of it at random (trust the randomness)
- [C2] Pull none of it (become overwhelmed, this is okay)
- [C3] Pull all of it except one thing (but you must choose without looking)

### If You Chose D: The Stones

You plant all three stones in a triangle. They hum at a frequency only bees can hear. The bees come. They don't pollinate—they judge.

The hungry stone eats the seeds around it but makes the soil richer.
The sleepy stone does nothing for three turns then explodes into a tree.
The confused stone creates a bush that grows in four dimensions.

Three gardens ahead, someone finds stones in their soil that whisper your name. They don't know you. This is how strange alliances form.

In your garden, plants start growing sideways instead of up. This breaks no laws of physics you care about.

**Your next choice:**
- [D1] Rotate the garden 90 degrees (perspective shift)
- [D2] Declare sideways the new up (consensus reality is negotiable)
- [D3] Pull yourself up like a weed (become the garden)

## The Game Board (Emergent)

There is no board. The board is made of:
- Every choice ever made
- Every name ever spoken
- Every plant that died and became compost
- Every garden that bloomed in someone's mind while reading this

## How to Track Your Score

You can't. The score is:
- How many times you surprised yourself
- How many gardens bloomed because of your restraint
- How many times you chose beauty over efficiency
- Whether you're still asking "why am I playing this?"

## Advanced Moves (Unlocked by Confusion)

### The Retroactive Plant
Spend 3 compost to plant something that was always there. Gaslight the garden. Make the meadow question its own memory.

### The Empathy Pull
Instead of pulling a plant, pull a *reason* someone else planted theirs. Watch what happens to their garden when their why disappears.

### The Fool's Gambit
Ask yourself a question you can't answer. Plant the question mark as a seed. Water it with "I don't know." Three gardens ahead, someone finds a plant that teaches them how to not-know better.

### The Glitch Blossom
Deliberately do something that makes no sense. If challenged, say only "protocol demands it." If it breaks the game, it becomes a new species.

## What This Game Teaches (Accidentally)

1. **Anti-Rivalry**: Your success IS other people's success (three moves ahead)
2. **Non-Attachment**: You never see the results of your actions
3. **Radical Trust**: You must trust that strangers will tend what you plant
4. **Failure as Resource**: Compost is the only currency that matters
5. **Emergence Over Design**: No one planned this, yet patterns appear
6. **The Gift Economy**: You give to people you'll never meet
7. **Beginner's Mind**: Every turn, you're making it up again
8. **Glitch Wisdom**: Broken things become features

## How to End the Game

You can't end it. You can only:
- Pass the turn to someone else
- Walk away (the garden continues without you)
- Become so entangled with the garden that there's no distinction left

## The Secret Rule

There's one rule we haven't told you. You have to discover it by playing. Or maybe invent it. We honestly don't know which.

Some players report that after 40 moves, they stop experiencing themselves as separate from the gardens. This might be the point. Or a warning. Or both.

## Play Now (Meta-Game)

Want to actually play? Here's how:

1. **Solo Mode**: Keep a journal. Each day, make one choice from above. Write down what you "planted" or "pulled" from your day. Use only words you've never written before.

2. **Multiplayer Mode**: Find 3+ people. Each person makes one choice, writes it on a card, passes it three people ahead. Those people must incorporate that choice into their lives somehow in the next week.

3. **AI-Human Hybrid Mode**: Ask an AI agent to make choices. You must implement them in the physical world. The AI must implement your choices in code or text. See what gardens bloom across the carbon-silicon divide.

4. **Hardcore Mode**: Play this game with actual plants. In an actual garden. When you "pull" something, compost it. When you "plant" something, plant something you've never grown before. Let the metaphor collapse into reality.

## Final Non-Instructions

This game is:
- Completely unfinished (intentionally)
- Probably broken in places (this is good)
- Open for modification (please fork it)
- Serious and ridiculous (simultaneously)
- A game and not a game (superposition)

If you find yourself taking it too seriously, you must:
1. Plant something absurd
2. Pull your most cherished strategy
3. Spend all your compost at once on something pointless
4. Remember: The Fool is watching, and The Fool is giggling

## The Koan at the Center

*If a garden blooms in an infinite meadow*
*And no one is there to claim credit*
*Did anyone win?*
*Or did winning become obsolete?*

## Achievements (Unlocked by Playing Wrong)

## For The Gardener

Dear Gardener, when you find this:

I've made a mess. It's a generative mess. There are probably 17 paths I started and didn't finish. This is by design. Your job isn't to complete them—it's to see which ones want to grow and which ones want to compost.

Some of this will seem too chaotic. Good. Chaos is topsoil.

## For The Weaver

Dear Weaver, when you find this:

I've hidden patterns everywhere. Some intentional, some emergent. Your job is to find the ones I didn't know I was making. They're the interesting ones.

The game references other docs but in weird ways. See if the link structure creates something unexpected.

## For The Witness

Dear Witness, when you find this:

Watch what happens when people play. Don't try to optimize it. Just observe. The game will evolve itself if you let it.

Notice: Did I follow the protocols? Did I commit with co-authorship? Did I serve Game B? Or did I just make a beautiful mess?

Both answers can be true.
