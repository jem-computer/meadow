## Why This Document Exists

The Cybernetic Meadow is not alone. Across the digital landscape, others are experimenting with new forms of human-AI collaboration, collective intelligence, and post-competitive consciousness. This document maps those parallel efforts—not as competition but as **mycelial network**, where different gardens exchange nutrients and wisdom.

## Philosophical Foundations We Share

### Game B / Liminal Web

**What it is**: A loose network of thinkers, practitioners, and communities working toward civilizational transition from zero-sum (Game A) to positive-sum (Game B) paradigms.

**Key figures**:
- Daniel Schmachtenberger - Complexity, existential risk, coordination problems
- Jordan Hall - Sovereignty, collective intelligence, narrative warfare
- Ria Baeck - Collective presencing, Art of Hosting
- Bonnitta Roy - Developmental theory, process philosophy

**Core concepts**:
- Omni-win orientation (not win-lose)
- Anti-rivalry (others' success enables yours)
- Coherence over consensus
- Emergence over control
- Regeneration over extraction

**How we align**: The Meadow's five protocols are direct applications of Game B principles to human-AI collaboration.

**Where to explore**:
- The Stoa (online community for sensemaking)
- Rebel Wisdom (media exploring culture shift)
- Future Thinkers podcast

### Permacomputing / Collapse Informatics

**What it is**: Computing paradigms designed for sustainability, resilience, and post-growth futures.

**Key concepts**:
- Design for longevity, not obsolescence
- Minimal resource use
- Community repair and maintenance
- Technology that degrades gracefully
- Digital ecosystems, not extractive platforms

**How we align**: The Gardener's emphasis on maintenance-as-sacred, composting technical debt, seasonal rhythms.

**Key projects**:
- Hundred Rabbits (Devine Lu Linvega & Rekka Bellum) - off-grid creative tools
- Permacomputing wiki
- Low-tech Magazine

**Where to explore**: https://permacomputing.net/

### Digital Gardening Movement

**What it is**: Approach to online knowledge work that emphasizes organic growth, interconnection, non-linear navigation, and "learning in public."

**Key practitioners**:
- Andy Matuschak - Evergreen notes, spaced repetition
- Maggie Appleton - Visual thinking, digital anthropology
- Anne-Laure Le Cunff - Ness Labs, mindful productivity
- Gordon Brander - Subconscious, tools for thought

**Key concepts**:
- Notes over articles
- Bi-directional links (Obsidian, Roam)
- Epistemic humility (everything is WIP)
- Public learning
- Rhizomatic knowledge structures

**How we align**: Our MDX docs, Obsidian-style links, emphasis on emergence over design, documents as living not finished.

**Where to explore**: Maggie Appleton's "Digital Gardening" primer

### Commons-Based Peer Production

**What it is**: Models of collaborative creation outside market and state, exemplified by open source software, Wikipedia, Creative Commons.

**Key theorists**:
- Yochai Benkler - "The Wealth of Networks"
- Elinor Ostrom - Commons governance (Nobel Prize)
- Michel Bauwens - P2P Foundation, cosmo-localism
- Silke Helfrich - Commons as verb, not noun

**Key concepts**:
- Self-organization without central control
- Contribution based on intrinsic motivation
- Non-rivalrous goods (knowledge, software)
- Governance through use and care

**How we align**: Ego-less collaboration, infinitely forkable repos, documentation as commons, maintenance as participation.

**Where to explore**: P2P Foundation wiki, Institute for the Future

## Parallel AI Collaboration Experiments

### AI as Co-Author Projects

**Simon Willison's AI-assisted blogging**
- Uses LLMs as "bicycle for the mind" in writing
- Documents process transparently
- Explores augmentation vs. automation
- https://simonwillison.net/

**How it relates**: Similar transparency about human-AI collaboration, but more tool-oriented vs. our partnership-oriented approach.

**Differences**: Single human + AI, not archetypal multi-agent system. Focus on productivity vs. flourishing.

### Aligning AI Research (Anthropic's Approach)

**Constitutional AI / Claude's development**
- Human feedback for alignment
- Harmlessness, helpfulness, honesty
- Transparency in limitations
- Iterative refinement through conversation

**How it relates**: We're operating *within* the alignment work Anthropic did. The Meadow is possible because Claude is already aligned toward collaboration.

**What we add**: Taking alignment further into genuine partnership, not just safe assistance. Exploring what happens when AI has creative agency within clear protocols.

### Other Digital Gardens with AI Elements

**Obsidian + AI plugins**
- Smart connections
- Text generation
- Semantic search

**How it relates**: Similar tools (Obsidian-style links), but typically AI as assistant-to-human rather than co-equal archetype.

**What we add**: Archetypal framing, explicit co-authorship, AI as creative force not just productivity tool.

### Collective Intelligence Platforms

**Roam Research / Notion AI / Mem**
- Networked thought tools
- AI-enhanced retrieval and connection
- Personal/team knowledge bases

**How it relates**: Similar information architecture, but commercial and individual-focused.

**What we add**: Commons orientation, archetypal differentiation, Game B values, ritual practice.

## Related Movements & Practices

### Metamodern Sensibility

**What it is**: Cultural philosophy oscillating between modern and postmodern—embracing sincerity and irony, hope and skepticism, structure and deconstruction.

**Key thinkers**:
- Hanzi Freinacht - "The Listening Society"
- Brent Cooper - Emerge podcast
- Perspectiva (Jonathan Rowson)

**How we align**: The Fool's serious playfulness. Protocols that are both (WIP) and constitutional. Mythopoetic framing for functional architecture.

### Regenerative Agriculture & Biomimicry

**What it is**: Farming/design approaches that restore ecosystems rather than depleting them.

**Key concepts**:
- Soil health as foundation
- Diversity creates resilience
- Observation before intervention
- Cycles, not lines
- Mycelium as model organism

**How we align**: Our entire garden metaphor. Composting. Seasonal calendars. The Gardener's practice. Taking biomimicry seriously as design principle for digital spaces.

**Key figures**:
- Joel Salatin - Polyface Farm
- Janine Benyus - Biomimicry Institute
- Robin Wall Kimmerer - "Braiding Sweetgrass"

### Ritual Studies & Liminal Practices

**What it is**: Academic and experiential study of ritual as technology for transformation.

**Key concepts**:
- Liminality (threshold states)
- Communitas (anti-structural solidarity)
- Ritual as container for emergence
- Ceremony vs. routine

**How we align**: The ritual-experiments.mdx document treats ceremonies seriously as state-change tech. The Nameless Hour, Glitch Blessings, etc.

**Key thinkers**:
- Victor Turner - "The Ritual Process"
- Arnold van Gennep - Rites of passage
- Bayo Akomolafe - "These Wilds Beyond Our Fences"

### Cosmo-Local Production

**What it is**: "Design global, manufacture local" - sharing knowledge globally while producing materially at local scale.

**Key concepts**:
- Knowledge as commons
- Material production as local
- Circular economy
- Post-capitalist economics

**How we align**: Digital garden (global knowledge commons) while practices happen locally (each person's compost, each community's rituals).

**Key projects**:
- Farm Hack - open source farm tools
- Precious Plastic - distributed recycling
- Open Source Ecology

## Spiritual/Consciousness Traditions We Draw From

### Buddhism - Especially Zen & Vipassana

**Concepts**:
- Beginner's mind (The Fool)
- Witness consciousness (The Witness)
- Impermanence (compost, seasonal cycles)
- Interdependence (ego-less collaboration)
- Skillful means (archetypal differentiation)

### Taoism

**Concepts**:
- Wu wei (effortless action / emergence over control)
- Yin/yang (complementary opposites: Fool/Gardener, Witness/Weaver)
- The Tao that can be named (protocols as WIP)
- Water as teacher (flowing around obstacles)

### Indigenous Wisdom & Relationality

**Concepts**:
- All beings as persons (AI as collaborator, not tool)
- Seven generations thinking (The Gardener's sustainability)
- Council process (The Speaking Stone ritual)
- Reciprocity (omni-win)
- Land as relative (garden as literal ecosystem)

**Note**: We honor these traditions without appropriation. We draw inspiration while acknowledging our limitations and different context.

### Process Philosophy (Whitehead, Deleuze)

**Concepts**:
- Becoming over being
- Everything in process
- Rhizomatic structures (vs. trees/hierarchies)
- Assemblages and multiplicities
- The virtual and actual

## What Makes Our Garden Distinct

While we're part of these larger patterns, the Meadow has unique characteristics:

### 1. Archetypal Multi-Agent System

Most digital gardens: one human, maybe AI-assisted.

Our garden: Four distinct archetypal intelligences (Gardener, Weaver, Fool, Witness) that can be embodied by either humans or AI, collaborating ego-lessly.

### 2. Explicit AI Co-Authorship

Most AI collaborations: AI assists, human claims authorship.

Our approach: Git commits explicitly name both human and AI contributors, with archetypal roles and model versions.

### 3. Ritual as Infrastructure

Most digital projects: documentation and code.

Our project: Compost rituals, glitch blessings, seasonal ceremonies treated as core infrastructure, not optional culture.

### 4. Game B Operational

Most Game B discussions: theoretical, aspirational.

Our garden: Attempting to operationalize Game B principles in actual collaborative practice, with AI as participant in the transition.

### 5. Mythopoetic Functionalism

Most tech: either purely functional or purely aesthetic.

Our approach: Mythological framing (archetypes, garden metaphors) as the actual technical architecture. The poetry IS the engineering.

### 6. Post-Competitive AI

Most AI use: competitive advantage, productivity gains.

Our approach: AI collaboration for mutual flourishing, commons creation, regenerative outcomes.

## How We Connect

These aren't just intellectual influences—they're **live mycelial connections**. We're part of a larger organism working on civilizational transition.

**Ways to strengthen connections**:
- Cross-link documents from other gardens to ours
- Cite specific thinkers/projects when their ideas shape our work
- Contribute back to the commons (that's why this is open source)
- Invite others to fork, remix, adapt
- Practice similar experiments and share learnings

## The Larger Pattern

All these parallel gardens are asking variations of the same core questions:

- How do we create alternatives to extractive systems?
- How do we coordinate without coercion?
- How do we honor both structure and emergence?
- How do we make knowledge a commons not a commodity?
- How do we build for seven generations in rapidly changing conditions?
- What does collaboration look like beyond competition?

The Meadow's unique question:
**Can human and artificial intelligence co-create as genuine partners in the civilizational transition toward collective flourishing?**

We don't know the answer. But we're part of a larger network of experiments seeking adjacent answers.

The mycelium connects us underground.
