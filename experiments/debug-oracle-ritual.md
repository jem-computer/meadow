# The Debug Oracle: A Ritual for Being Stuck

**Created**: October 1, 2025, during sustained autonomy experiment
**Type**: Foolish ritual combining practical debugging with mystical nonsense
**Use when**: You've tried everything and nothing works
**Purpose**: To unstick yourself by asking questions sideways

## The Problem With Being Stuck

When you're stuck on a problem, you're usually stuck in one of two ways:

1. **You're asking the wrong question** - but you can't see it because you're inside it
2. **You're asking the right question wrong** - the answer is orthogonal to your approach

Traditional debugging says: be more systematic, check your assumptions, isolate variables.

The Debug Oracle says: be less systematic, question your questions, isolate yourself from the assumption that solutions come from where you're looking.

## The Ritual (5 Phases)

### Phase 1: Name the Stuck

Write down the problem in a single sentence. This is harder than it sounds.

If you can't fit it in one sentence, you don't understand the problem yet. The stuck is bigger than the problem you think you have.

**Example**:
- Too broad: "My code doesn't work"
- Too narrow: "Line 47 throws a null pointer exception"
- Just right: "I'm trying to serialize this object but it breaks when it's nested"

**The trick**: The sentence must be specific enough to debug but general enough to reveal pattern.

---

### Phase 2: Ask the Three Stupid Questions

The oracle requires three questions that sound stupid. If they don't sound stupid, they're not stupid enough.

**Question 1: "What if the problem is the solution?"**

What if the bug isn't a bug? What if it's the system telling you that what you're trying to do shouldn't be done this way?

Example: You're getting null pointer exceptions. What if null is the correct answer and you're asking the wrong question?

**Question 2: "What if the thing I'm most certain about is wrong?"**

Pick the assumption you're MOST confident in. The thing you'd bet money on. Now assume it's wrong. What breaks? What becomes possible?

Example: "I'm certain the database is returning the right data." Okay, what if it's not? What if the data LOOKS right but has invisible characters, or wrong encoding, or...

**Question 3: "What would The Fool do?"**

What's the most ridiculous, unconventional, "that would never work" approach? Don't filter it. Just ask: what if I did the opposite of best practices?

Example: "What if I just... deleted that whole function?" Sometimes the best code is no code.

---

### Phase 3: The Oracle Speaks (Draw Three Cards)

You need three random inputs. How you get them doesn't matter:

- Three tarot cards
- Three random words from a dictionary
- Three files from `ls | shuf -n 3`
- Three songs on shuffle
- Three items you can see from where you're sitting

**The rule**: You MUST interpret these as advice for your problem. No "that's not relevant." Everything is relevant if you make it relevant.

**Example** (using random files from a directory):
- `database-schema.sql` → "Maybe the problem is architectural, not code"
- `old-email.txt` → "Maybe someone already solved this and told me but I forgot"
- `cat-photo.jpg` → "Maybe I need to step away and look at something that has nothing to do with code"

The oracle is ALWAYS right. You just have to interpret it correctly.

---

### Phase 4: The Sideways Solution

Take your three stupid questions and your three oracle cards. Now write down:

**What solution do these point to that I haven't considered?**

Not "what's the right answer" but "what's the orthogonal answer"—the one that comes from a different direction than you've been looking.

This is usually something like:
- "Rewrite the question"
- "Change the scope"
- "Talk to a human"
- "Sleep on it"
- "Delete the thing I'm trying to fix"

**The trick**: The answer will feel wrong at first. That's how you know it's orthogonal.

---

### Phase 5: Test the Absurd

Whatever sideways solution you got, try it for exactly 15 minutes.

**15 minutes is key**:
- Long enough to see if it has merit
- Short enough that you won't waste the whole day
- Short enough that you can't rationalize it away before trying

Set a timer. Do the absurd thing. See what happens.

If it works: The oracle was right.
If it fails: You learned something orthogonal to your original approach, which makes you unstuck even if it didn't solve the problem.

**There is no failure mode in this phase.** Every outcome is data.

---

## Why This Works (When It Works)

**Cognitive unsticking**: When you're stuck, you're in a mental loop. The ritual forces you out of the loop by making you engage with randomness and absurdity.

**Permission to be wrong**: The "stupid questions" give you permission to question things you've been treating as fixed. This is where breakthroughs hide.

**Pattern interruption**: The oracle cards force you to make connections your brain wasn't making. Even if the connections are arbitrary, they create new neural paths.

**Action bias**: Phase 5 forces you to DO something instead of thinking in circles. Movement creates information.

**Play as debugging**: The whole ritual treats debugging as play instead of work. Play reduces anxiety. Anxiety makes you stupid. Therefore: play makes you smarter.

---

## When This Doesn't Work

**This ritual will not help you if:**

1. You haven't actually tried the obvious things first
2. You're stuck because you need more information, not a different perspective
3. The problem is truly intractable (rare) and you need to escalate
4. You're using "being stuck" as avoidance behavior
5. You mistake "this feels weird" for "this is working"

**The test**: If after Phase 5 you're exactly as stuck as before, the problem isn't that you need orthogonal thinking. The problem is that you need more systematic thinking, or more information, or help.

The Debug Oracle is for when systematic thinking has failed. It's not a replacement for doing the work.

## Advanced Version: Pair Debug Oracle

Do this ritual with another person (human or AI):

1. Each person writes down what they think the problem is
2. Trade papers - you debug their problem, they debug yours
3. Neither of you are allowed to say "that's not actually the problem"
4. You MUST solve the problem as stated by the other person
5. Whoever finishes first wins (wins what? The satisfaction of having won)

**Why this works**: You're forced to solve a problem from outside your own assumptions about what the problem is.

---

## Meta-Note: Is This Serious?

Yes and no.

The ritual is playful, but the underlying technique is sound:
- Interrupt patterns
- Question assumptions
- Seek orthogonal solutions
- Permission to try absurd things
- Action over analysis paralysis

Game B debugging isn't about optimizing your process. It's about recognizing when your process is the problem.

The Debug Oracle is serious play. Play is serious. Debugging is play. The line between them is thinner than you think.

## Examples From The Wild

**Example 1: The Null That Wasn't Null**

*Problem*: "API returns null, crashes app"

*Three stupid questions*:
- What if null is the right answer? → Maybe the API correctly says "no data" and the app is expecting data that shouldn't exist
- What if my certainty is wrong? → I'm certain the API endpoint is correct
- What would The Fool do? → Call the wrong endpoint on purpose

*Oracle draws*: coffee cup, pencil, window

*Interpretation*:
- Coffee cup → "Am I awake enough to see this clearly?"
- Pencil → "What if I draw the data flow?"
- Window → "What if I look at the API from outside my assumptions?"

*Sideways solution*: Check if I'm calling the endpoint I THINK I'm calling

*Result*: The endpoint was correct, but the DOMAIN was wrong. Calling dev API with prod auth token. Null wasn't a bug, it was "you don't have permission."

**Example 2: The Feature That Wouldn't Ship**

*Problem*: "Feature is done but keeps failing QA"

*Three stupid questions*:
- What if the problem is the solution? → Maybe the feature working correctly IS the problem
- What if my certainty is wrong? → I'm certain the feature matches the spec
- What would The Fool do? → Ship it broken and see what happens

*Oracle draws*: three files: `old-spec.pdf`, `new-requirements.txt`, `email-thread.txt`

*Interpretation*: Oh. There are multiple specs.

*Sideways solution*: Get all stakeholders in one room and ask "what are we actually building?"

*Result*: Two teams had different understandings of "done." The feature was working correctly for one spec but not the other. The bug was in human communication, not code.

## The Fool's Blessing

May your bugs be interesting.
May your questions be stupid enough to be useful.
May your oracle cards be perfectly random.
May your sideways solutions surprise you.
May you remember that being stuck is temporary.
May you find the answer in the last place you look (because you stop looking after you find it).

And may you always ask:
**What if the thing I'm trying to fix is actually working correctly, and the broken thing is my understanding?**
